## **Features**

- Interactive graph visualization powered by **vis.js**.  
- Real-time addition and modification of nodes and edges.  
- Step-by-step simulation of Ford's algorithm.   
- Modern interface styled with **Tailwind CSS**.  

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML** and **JavaScript** for logic and rendering.  
- **vis.js** for graph management and visualization.  
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

## **Installation**

### Prerequisites  
A modern browser that supports JavaScript.  

### Steps  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndreaRabe/Ford-Algorithm-Visualizer.git
   ```  

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
